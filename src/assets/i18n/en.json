    "intro": "Browser riddle games were quite popular a while back (and by a while I mean about 20 years). One of the most popular sites, Notpron, is still available today. I enjoyed these games so much that over the years I've created a number of them myself. This one is yet another love letter to the genre.",
    "about": "This game is quite straightforward, you will have an image - the puzzle itself, and have to figure out its solution. Once the correct solution is entered, you find yourself on the next page of the game with a new puzzle, until you reach the end. To keep this game simple, there are no hidden clues anywhere, you don't need to investigate outside the page, check the url or the developer tools, just figure out the image and you're done.",
